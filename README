Development test provided by ISS in support of my application for the graduate software developer role in Market Intelligence.

Dependencies:
    -> Qlik Picasso.js
    -> Qlik Leonardo-ui
    -> JQuery

Features Implemented:
    -> A barchart view showing total sales of select funds by select IFAs, the user can check/uncheck boxes under the chart to alter the data used.
    -> A piechart view showing market share ((sales/total sales) * 100) of each IFA within a select year, again funds included and the selected year can be altered using the fields.
    -> A tabset view using Leonardo-UI to show each chart on a different view.
    -> Prevention of unchecking all ifa/fund checkboxes to avoid empty charts.


Potential future features/improvements:
    -> One interesting feature would to have a year-on-year comparison of market share with the piechart, perhaps showing the relative increase/decrease between two years.
    -> Some more styling options, little things like padding on axis/chart titles or consistent colouring of charts.
    -> Perhaps an optional section detailing the dataset used to create each chart, for those users wanting to see it.
    -> Alternative charts, simple charts such as total sales (across all years) of each IFA or Fund.
        -> Could even have a chart showing sales of funds over the years, showing the trend of which fund(s) sell better over the years.


Reflection on Project:
It took a bit of time to get into the Qlik libraries, with which I had no prior experience with, and back into html, css and javascript development in general but once I did the project
went smoothly without many roadblocks. Given more time there are a few things I'd work on with the project (including those additional features above) such as some small inefficiencies
or questionable practices - one such instance would be the use of a timeout before the chart is rendered to ensure the getData function has time to run, instead it'd be much cleaner
and better practice to use a callback or deferred pattern to run these functions asynchronously.

Overall I have enjoyed working on this project, it's provided some more exposure to html, css and javascript (especially JS where I have less experience) and I have particularly liked
implementing some of the features.
